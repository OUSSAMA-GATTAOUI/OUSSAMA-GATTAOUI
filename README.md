Hi there! 👋

I'm Oussama Gattaoui, a Data Science engineering student (State Engineer track) at ENSAM Rabat, Morocco.  
I'm super passionate about turning messy data into clear insights, automating boring tasks, and occasionally playing cybersecurity detective. I love building things that actually solve problems — whether it's a slick desktop app or a system that blocks hackers.

💻 Skills  
- **Python** – my main weapon (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, PyQt5 for GUIs, automation, data cleaning & EDA)  
- **SQL** – advanced queries, databases, the works (HackerRank Advanced certified)  
- **Linux & Security** – Bash, iptables, ipset, TCP/IP, building IDS/IPS systems  
- **Other** – C / C++, basic HTML & CSS, Git, data visualization, preprocessing pipelines  
🎓 Currently  
Data Science student at École Nationale Supérieure d’Arts et Métiers (ENSAM) Rabat — 2023 → 2028  
Key courses: Data Analysis, Probability & Statistics, Databases (SQL), Algorithms, Linux, Computer Networks, Cybersecurity basics

🎮 Fun Facts  
- I love gaming! I play Rust even though I’m not sure why I enjoy it 😅  
- Huge fan of Souls games — the challenge and strategy are unbeatable  
- I enjoy solving puzzles and experimenting with code for fun  
- I sometimes enjoy "breaking" my PC for fun (don’t worry, I usually fix it 😎)
